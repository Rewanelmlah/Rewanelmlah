# 👋 Hi there, I'm Rewan Elmalah  

I’m a Business Analyst with a technical background in Flutter Development. I specialize in analyzing systems, gathering and documenting requirements, modeling business processes, and transforming ideas into structured solutions that bridge the gap between business needs and technology.

I have a strong foundation in software development, which empowers me to communicate effectively with both stakeholders and development teams.
